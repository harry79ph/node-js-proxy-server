# cors-proxy-server
This Proxy Server can be used to get data from endpoints where Cors is not enabled.
Append your non-cors url to your host (proxy server) url.
For example the url that we want to fetch data from: https://example.com
And our host url: https://my-host.com
Then we can use https://my-host.com/example.com to fetch the data.
